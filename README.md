# Project 1 - HTML
In this assignment, you will be creating two pages from a fictitious recipe website, The Lazy Chef. You are to create two html pages: index.html and suggest_recipe.html. A sample of the pages is given under the sample_pages directory.

## Index Page
This is the landing page of the website, and contains the featured recipe, links to additional recipes as well as a link to navigate to the suggest a recipe form (suggest_recipe.html).

A sample of the page is given in sample_pages/index.pdf.

The finished page should look identical in layout to the sample. You must create your own recipe (could take it from another site, just make sure to give credit). The links to the additional recipes should go to external sites (open in new tab). You should also provide your own picture for the finished recipe (once again, this can be taken from the web somewhere).

The page title should be specified as “The Lazy Chef - {{Your recipe name}}”.

## Suggest a Recipe Page
This page houses the form for the reader to submit their recipe to The Lazy Chef.  Match this page exactly in layout and in content. The page title should be specified as “The Lazy Chef - Suggest a Recipe”.

## Additional Requirements
In addition, your pages must meet the following additional requirements …

* Id’s must be placed on html elements where indicated in the layout specifications.
* You must use at least two HTML entities on the site.
* You must use the <abbr> tag at least two times on the site.
* All images should be stored in an _images_ folder on your site. Do not reference external images.
* All pages should validate against the W3C HTML validator.
* We will go over the layouts of the two pages in class. The layout should match what is discussed in class exactly.
